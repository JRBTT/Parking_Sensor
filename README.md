# Ultrasonic Parking Sensor
- Detect targets using ultrasonic sensor and provide indicators of closeness through a buzzer and an LED
- As target gets closer to the ultrasonic sensor, buzzing speed and LED blinking speed increase continuously
- As target gets increasingly away from the ultrasonic sensor, buzzing speed and LED blinking speed decrease continuously
- One pushbutton is used for turning on/off the buzzer and LED
- Another pushbutton is used for turning up/down buzzing volume with three distinct levels
- A photoresistor is used for controlling the brightness of the LED with three distinct levels (room light, covered by finger, shined by a torch)
